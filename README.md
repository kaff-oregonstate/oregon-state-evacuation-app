# oregon-state-evacuation-app

A suite of technologies to support Evacuation Drill Administration and Civil Engineering Evacuation Traffic Research.

1. [Evacuation Drill Participation App](evac_app/README.md)
    - A mobile Flutter app which administers surveys and evacuation drill instructions while also generating, encrypting, and uploading resultant datasets. 
1.  Evacuation Drill Researcher Console (not yet added)
    - A desktop Flutter app which downloads, decrypts, and parses survey and trajectory datasets generated by the mobile Drill Participation App.
1. [Firebase/GCP Backend](firebase/README.md)
    - A cloud backend to connect the mobile Drill Participation App and desktop Researcher Console.
    - While the source code for our cloud backend is private for the time being, we provide a description of steps taken to setup our cloud backend using Google Cloud Products.

Please see the README in each subdirectory for more detailed descriptions of the technology listed above. Alternatively, __[Drill Procedure](evac_app/DRILL_PROCEDURE.md)__ walks through the process of creating, running, and gathering the results from an evacuation drill event using this suite of technologies.
