# oregon-state-evacuation-app

A suite of technologies to support Evacuation Drill Administration and Civil Engineering Evacuation Traffic Research.

1. [Evacuation Drill Participation App](evac_app/README.md)
    - A mobile Flutter app which administers surveys and evacuation drill instructions while also generating, encrypting, and uploading resultant datasets. 
1.  Evacuation Drill Researcher Console (not yet added)
    - A desktop Flutter app which downloads, decrypts, and parses survey and trajectory datasets generated by the mobile Drill Participation App.
1. [Firebase/GCP Backend](firebase/README.md)
    - A cloud backend to connect the mobile Drill Participation App and desktop Researcher Console.
    - While the source code for our cloud backend is private for the time being, we provide a description of steps taken to setup our cloud backend using Google Cloud Products.

Please see the README in each subdirectory for more detailed descriptions of the technology listed above. Alternatively, __[Drill Procedure](evac_app/DRILL_PROCEDURE.md)__ walks through the process of creating, running, and gathering the results from an evacuation drill event using this suite of technologies.

## Motivation

Our Evacuation Drill Participation App was designed to gather data from users who participate in drill events hosted by Dr. Haizhong Wang and his research team at Oregon State University. These drills are performed to understand the level of tsunami evacuation preparedness in coastal communities, and how best to serve these communities in the event of a such a disaster.

To support the mobile Participation App, we also created: 
1. a server-less backend using Firebase to transfer and store data, and 
1. a desktop Researcher Console to download, decrypt, and parse drill results

We hope that this project will be extended for use in a variety of evacuation scenarios for communities of all sorts.
