# Suggested Improvements

This document discusses improvements to the mobile Evacuation Drill Participation App which the initial development team can foresee but does not have the resources to implement. There is some overlap with the documented [Issues](issues), but there are also complex improvements which have not yet been documented as Issues.

## Persistence

(app currently loses all data on close/crash)

## Pre- & Post-Drill Instructions

(where to meet researchers day of event, after drill completion) (maps link, copy address to keyboard)

## Allow Drill Event to be Joined Prior to Time of Event

(need to save data persistently and provide a way to access at a later date)

## Start Drill on Researcher Signal
